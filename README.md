Because we want to write externals for PD in this course, we are based on the coding style of Miller Puckette.

Therefore, there are the following spelling conventions:

Functions:
"pseudoClassInLowerCamelCase_methodOfTheClassObject"

Structs:
@code
typedef struct _structName 
{
...
} t_structName
@endcode
