# Real-Time Audio Programming In C
Teaching material for the programming seminar ["Real-Time Audio Programming In C"](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/sommersemester_2019/real_time_audio_programmierung_in_c/) of the summer semester 2019 



Because we want to write externals for PD in this course, we are based on the coding style of [Miller Puckette](http://msp.ucsd.edu/).

Therefore, there are the following spelling conventions:

### Functions:
´pseudoClassInLowerCamelCase_methodOfTheClassObject´

### Structs:

´typedef struct _structName 
{
...
} t_structName
